# Access Control Lists tasks:
1. 
- As a **root** user **create** a user called **aclusr**, and the directory **/tmp/acldir** and **create** two empty files under **acldir**.
- **change** the directory's group owner to **aclusr** group. Make sure to include the directory content with this change.
- **Remove** all the permissions of the directory and its content for the **group owner** and **others**.
2.

- **Check** the access control list on the **acldir** after the above changes.
- **switch** to **aclusr** and try to to go inside the **acldir** and write in any of the files.
