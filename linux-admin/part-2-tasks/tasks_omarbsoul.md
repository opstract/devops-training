One

Two
Three
Four
Five
^d
19. Use cp to make a backup of count.txt file to cnt.txt.

20. Use cat to make a backup of count.txt file to catcnt.txt.
$cat count.txt > catcnt.txt
21. Display catcnt.txt, but with all lines in reverse order (the last line first).

$cat /etc/passwd tailing.txt > tailing.txt
28. Does the file /bin/cat exist ? What about /bin/dd and /bin/echo. What is the type of these files ?
# Yes they exist, we can verify that by using 'ls' cmd
$ls /bin/cat /bin/dd /bin/echo
# Binary files
$file -b /bin/cat /bin/dd /bin/echo
29. Display /proc/cpuinfo. On what architecture is your Linux running ?
# Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz
$cat /proc/cpuinfo
30. Are ifconfig, fdisk, parted, shutdown and grub-install present in /sbin ? Why are these binaries in /sbin and not in /bin ?
# Because almost all of them can modify a major configuration of the system so not any one logged in to the system is authorized to do so, that is why system binaries have sperate directory called 'sbin' 
31.  Is /var/log a file or a directory ? What about /var/spool ?
# Since there is a 'd' flag for both 'spool' and 'log' then they are directories (and each directory is a file)
$ls -l /var
